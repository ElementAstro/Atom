## Best Practices

1. **Overflow and Underflow Handling**: Always use the safe arithmetic functions (`safeAdd`, `safeSub`, `safeMul`, `safeDiv`) when dealing with operations that might result in overflow or underflow.

2. **Bit Manipulation**: For bit manipulation operations, use `rotl64`, `rotr64`, and `bitReverse64` instead of implementing these operations manually to ensure correctness and efficiency.

3. **Integer Square Root**: When an approximate square root is sufficient, use `approximateSqrt` for better performance compared to floating-point operations.

4. **GCD and LCM**: Use `gcd64` and `lcm64` for efficient calculations of greatest common divisor and least common multiple, respectively.

5. **Power of Two Operations**: Utilize `isPowerOfTwo` and `nextPowerOfTwo` when working with power-of-two values, as these are optimized for such operations.

## Example Usage

Here's an example demonstrating the use of several functions from this library:

```cpp
#include "math.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    uint64_t a = 1234567890;
    uint64_t b = 987654321;

    // Safe arithmetic operations
    uint64_t sum = atom::algorithm::safeAdd(a, b);
    uint64_t product = atom::algorithm::safeMul(a, b);

    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Product: " << product << std::endl;

    // Bit manipulation
    uint64_t rotated = atom::algorithm::rotl64(a, 8);
    uint64_t reversed = atom::algorithm::bitReverse64(a);

    std::cout << "Rotated left by 8: " << rotated << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Bit-reversed: " << reversed << std::endl;

    // Mathematical operations
    uint64_t sqrt = atom::algorithm::approximateSqrt(a);
    uint64_t gcd = atom::algorithm::gcd64(a, b);
    uint64_t lcm = atom::algorithm::lcm64(a, b);

    std::cout << "Approximate square root: " << sqrt << std::endl;
    std::cout << "GCD: " << gcd << std::endl;
    std::cout << "LCM: " << lcm << std::endl;

    // Power of two operations
    uint64_t n = 63;
    bool isPower = atom::algorithm::isPowerOfTwo(n);
    uint64_t nextPower = atom::algorithm::nextPowerOfTwo(n);

    std::cout << "Is " << n << " a power of two? " << (isPower ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Next power of two after " << n << ": " << nextPower << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates how to use various functions from the `math.hpp` library, including safe arithmetic operations, bit manipulation, mathematical calculations, and power-of-two operations.

## Notes

- All functions in this library are designed to work with 64-bit unsigned integers (`uint64_t`).
- The safe arithmetic functions return 0 in case of overflow, underflow, or division by zero. Always check the return value when using these functions in critical calculations.
- The `approximateSqrt` function provides a fast approximation and may not be suitable for applications requiring high precision.
- When working with very large numbers, be aware of the limitations of 64-bit integers and consider using arbitrary-precision arithmetic libraries for more demanding calculations.
