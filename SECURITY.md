## Supported Versions

Lithium follows an aggressive update strategy and typically only provides support for the latest software version. Bugs in older versions are generally fixed in the newer releases. Each major version has its own lifecycle, and support for older versions is discontinued once they reach their end of life.

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| indev    | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.0    | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any vulnerabilities, please report them by joining our QQ group or submitting an issue on GitHub. Vulnerability reports through other channels may not be effectively addressed.

We appreciate detailed vulnerability reports that include sufficient information to understand and reproduce the issue. By following responsible disclosure practices, you help us address the vulnerability effectively and protect our users.

Please note that only vulnerabilities reported through the specified channels will be considered for further investigation. We will make our best efforts to investigate and resolve the reported vulnerabilities promptly. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will take appropriate corrective actions.

Thank you for your attention to the security of the Lithium project and your contribution towards making it more secure.
